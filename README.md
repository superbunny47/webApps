Online Payment Service
======================

Introduction
------------

Welcome to the **Online Payment Service**, a Django-based web application designed to facilitate secure payments and payment requests between users with support for multiple currencies (GBP, USD, and EUR). This project fulfills an academic assignment by implementing user registration, authentication, payment processing, payment requests, and an administrative interface, with currency conversion handled via a dedicated RESTful API. The application ensures a seamless user experience with Bootstrap 5 styling and maintains data integrity using a SQLite database. This repository contains the complete source code, including migration files and a preconfigured database with sample users, making it easy to set up and explore.

The project showcases:

* **User Management**: Registration, login, and logout with customizable user profiles.
* **Payment Functionality**: Direct payments and payment requests with automatic currency conversion.
* **RESTful API**: A separate endpoint for currency conversion using hard-coded exchange rates.
* **Admin Interface**: Full administrative control, including user and transaction management.
* **Database**: Prepopulated with sample users and transactions for immediate use.

This README provides step-by-step instructions to recreate the environment, run the application, and explore its features.

Setup and Installation
----------------------

To recreate this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

* **Python 3.11+**: Ensure Python is installed (check with `python --version` or `python3 --version`).
* **Git**: For cloning the repository (install via `git` or your package manager).
* **Virtual Environment**: Recommended for dependency isolation.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1.  **Clone the Repository**  
    Clone this repository to your local machine using:
    
        git clone https://github.com/yourusername/webapps2025.git
        cd webapps2025
    
2.  **Set Up a Virtual Environment**  
    Create and activate a virtual environment:
    
        python -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    
3.  **Install Dependencies**  
    Install the required Python packages from the included `requirements.txt`:
    
        pip install -r requirements.txt
    
    (Note: If `requirements.txt` is missing, generate it with `pip freeze > requirements.txt` after installing dependencies manually.)
4.  **Apply Migrations**  
    The repository includes migration files. Apply them to set up the database schema:
    
        python manage.py migrate
    
5.  **Use the Preconfigured Database**  
    The repository includes a pre-existing SQLite database (`webapps.db`) with:
    
    #### Sample Users
    
    | Username | Email | Password | Currency | Balance |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | user1 | user1@mail.com | Abc123!!! | GBP | 750.00 |
    | user2 | user2@mail.com | Abc123!!! | USD | 990.00 |
    | user3 | user3@mail.com | Abc123!!! | EUR | 885.00 |
    
    #### Admin User
    
    | Username | Email | Password | Is Superuser |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | admin | admin@mail.com | admin | True |
    
    No additional database setup is required; the database is ready for use.
6.  **Run the Development Server**  
    Start the Django server:
    
        python manage.py runserver
    
7.  **Access the Application**  
    Open your browser and navigate to:
    
    * **Main Application**: [http://127.0.0.1:8000/webapps2025/login](http://127.0.0.1:8000/webapps2025/login)
    * **Admin Interface**: [http://127.0.0.1:8000/webapps2025/admin/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/webapps2025/admin/)
    
    Log in with the preconfigured credentials (e.g., `user1` with password `Abc123!!!` or `admin` with password `admin`).
8.  **Explore Features**  
    Register new users, send payments, request payments, and manage transactions.  
    Use the admin interface to view or edit data (superuser privileges required for balance changes).

### Notes

* Ensure the server is running for currency conversions to work during registration or payment processing.
* The application uses Bootstrap 5 for styling, enabled via `crispy-bootstrap5`.

Project Structure
-----------------

* `payapp/`: Contains payment-related models, views, and the currency conversion API.
* `register/`: Handles user registration, login, and authentication.
* `templates/`: HTML templates with Bootstrap 5 styling.
* `webapps2025/`: Project configuration files (settings, URLs, etc.).
* `webapps.db`: Prepopulated SQLite database with sample data.
* `migrations/`: Database migration files for schema setup.

Dependencies
------------

* Django 5.1.7
* djangorestframework
* django-crispy-forms
* crispy-bootstrap5
* requests

(Install via `pip install -r requirements.txt`.)

Currency Conversion Rates
-------------------------

The RESTful API (`/api/convert/`) uses the following hard-coded exchange rates (defined in `payapp/views.py`):

| From | To  | Rate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GBP | EUR | 1.18 |
| GBP | USD | 1.32 |
| EUR | GBP | 0.85 |
| EUR | USD | 1.12 |
| USD | GBP | 0.76 |
| USD | EUR | 0.89 |

Challenges and Solutions
------------------------

During the development of this project, several challenges were encountered and successfully overcome:

* **Currency Conversion Consistency**: Initially, the registration form (`register/forms.py`) implemented its own hardcoded currency conversion (e.g., 750 * 1.18 for EUR), duplicating logic from the RESTful API. This risked inconsistency if rates changed. **Solution**: The form was updated to use the `/api/convert/` endpoint via the `convert_currency` utility, ensuring all conversions align with the API’s hard-coded rates.
* **Admin Interface Balance Editing**: The `balance` field was set as read-only in the admin interface, preventing necessary adjustments. **Solution**: Implemented dynamic read-only logic in `register/admin.py`, allowing superusers to edit balances while restricting non-superusers, with a `PermissionDenied` check for security.
* **Payment Request Direction**: The payment request system initially deducted money from the requester instead of the target, reversing the intended flow (e.g., User 1 requesting from User 2). **Solution**: Adjusted the `transactions` view in `payapp/views.py` to deduct from the target’s balance and credit the requester, with proper currency conversion.
* **Initial Database Setup**: Recreating the project required consistent database initialization, including sample users. **Solution**: Included a preconfigured `webapps.db` with users (user1, user2, user3) and an admin, avoiding manual setup steps.

These solutions enhanced the project’s reliability, compliance with assignment requirements, and usability for future developers or evaluators.
